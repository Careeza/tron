
Photon Mac OS X SDK
------------------------------------------

Photon is the world's #1 independent networking engine and multiplayer platform â€” Fast, reliable, scalable.

Use the Photon Mac OS X SDK to easily add multiplayer to your games.
Run them in the global Photon Cloud or host your own Photon Servers.
Match your players to a shared game session (called "room") and transfer messages synchronously, in real-time, between connected players across platforms.
All client SDKs can interact with each other, no matter if iOS, Android, web, console or standalone.

/Demos

	/demo_basics:
	The demo client is basically a 'Hello World'. So it's the best place to start if you are new to the SDK. It is implemented in C++.

	/demo_chat:
	The demo shows a basic way of using the Photon Chat API within a console. It is implemented in C++.	

	/demo_loadBalancing:
	The demo client connects to a master server and shows how to create a room, join a random game and how to send and receive events within a running game. It is implemented in C++.

	/demo_loadBalancing_objc:
	The demo client connects to a master server and shows how to create a room, join a random game and how to send and receive events within a running game. It is implemented in Objective-C.

	/demo_loadBalancing_swift:
	The demo client connects to a master server and shows how to create a room, join a random game and how to send and receive events within a running game. It is implemented in Swift.

	/demo_particle:
	The demo client connects to a master server and shows the random matchmaking mechanism, how to create a room and how to send and receive events within a running game.
	Blocks are being moved automatically and the positions are updated in realtime between clients. This is a console application which is implemented in C++.

	/demo_typeSupport:
	This demo displays the proper use of Photon's serializable data types. It is implemented in C++.

	/demo_typeSupport_objc:
	This demo displays the proper use of Photon's serializable data types. It is implemented in Objective-C.
