// don't ever use NSAssert(), as it is evil! Details: NSAssert() isn't actually triggering an assert, but an InternalInconsistencyException, which could be caught by the app and that can lead into hard to find memory leaks (example: classic objC [[[Foo alloc] init] autorelease] and an NSAssert in init that gets catched at a higher level location in the calling stack -> autorelease won't ever be called and Foo leaks, although the intention of the NSAssert()-call has been to either terminate the app or continue with normal code execution, but under no circumstances to recover without calling the full code)
